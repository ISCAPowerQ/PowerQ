## ⚙️ Quick Start

### 1. Setup the Python Environment

```bash
cd Algorithm
conda create -n PowerQ python=3.10 -y
conda activate PowerQ
```

### 2. Run Algorithm Module

```bash
bash run_exp.sh
```

> ⚠️ Make sure to adjust the model and dataset paths in `run_exp.sh` as needed.

### 3. Run Hardware Simulation

```bash
cd ../Hardware
conda activate PowerQ  # Reuse the same environment

# Set HuggingFace cache path
export HF_HOME="your/HF_HOME/directory"

# Profile model shapes
bash run_shape_profile.sh

# Run inference simulation on different accelerator backends
python test_baseline.py --is_generation   # Baseline FP16
python test_ant.py      --is_generation   # ANT
python test_olive.py    --is_generation   # OliVe
python test_bitmod.py   --is_generation   # BitMoD
python test_powerq.py   --is_generation   # PowerQ (proposed)
```
